# Semantically equivalent

# Explanation
"DEFAULT_BUFFER_RESIZE_FACTOR" is a constant of type int, whose value is 2. In the constructor declaration "this(int lineLength)", there is such a statement as follows:

this.lineLength = lineLength > 0 ? (lineLength / 4) * 4 : 0;

When the value of "lineLength" is less than 4, the calculated result is equal to 0. Thus, regardless of whether it is 0 or 2(DEFAULT_BUFFER_RESIZE_FACTOR), there will be no change in the subsequent program running status.
