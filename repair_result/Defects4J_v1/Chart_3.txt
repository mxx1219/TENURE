Chart_3:

--------------------
real patch:
org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeries@1057
  TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();
+ copy.minY = Double.NaN;
+ copy.maxY = Double.NaN;

--------------------
patch generated by TENURE:
- TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();
+ TimeSeries copy = new TimeSeries(start);


# Semantically equivalent

# Explanation:
When the constructor "TimeSeries(Comparable name)" is called to generate the new object "copy", the two statements that need to be added in the real patch exist in its method body.
new TimeSeries(start)
  --> public TimeSeries(Comparable name)
    --> public TimeSeries(Comparable name, String domain, String range){ ... this.minY = Double.NaN; this.maxY = Double.NaN; ...}
